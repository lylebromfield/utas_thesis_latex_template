README for a LaTeX template for higher-degree research theses at the University of Tasmania.

Origin:
Adapted from https://github.com/mdsumner/utas_latex_thesis and generalized beyond IMAS. Forked from https://github.com/wghuneke/UTasIMAS_PhDThesis_Template, which slightly tweaked the mdsumner version for IMAS.

Key files:
- thesis.tex: main driver; controls which component files are included.
- utasthesis.sty: layout and formatting (margins, headers/footers, front matter).
- components/prelude.tex: candidate metadata (title, author, department/college), abstract, acknowledgements, optional co-authorship statement.

Structure:
- components/newcom.tex: your custom commands.
- components/acronym.tex: list of acronyms.
- chapters/chapter1/chapter1.tex, chapters/chapter2/chapter2.tex: starter chapter files (copy/rename to add more).
- appendices/app0/app0.tex: switches to appendix mode; add your appendix files after it.
- components/biby.tex: bibliography include.
- components/index.tex: optional index include (enable in thesis.tex).

Notes:
- Edit components/prelude.tex to set department/college and thesis metadata. The college line on the title page is optional.
- Replace logo.png with an appropriate UTAS/college logo if needed.
- thesis.tex currently includes chapters/chapter1/chapter1, chapters/chapter2/chapter2, appendices/app0/app0, components/biby, and components/index; add more includes as you create chapters/appendices, and use \includeonly in thesis.tex to speed compilation while drafting.
- Each chapter lives under its own folder in chapters/ and can keep figures in a per-chapter figures/ subfolder to avoid clutter.
- Default packages include acronym, natbib (apalike style), and hyperref (links hidden).

Happy writing!
